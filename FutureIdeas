When Entering game results, with the time of the goal and the period and team, we don't need to enter the box score

Enter Game Report Functionality
- Split into 3 different pages
1. Select a game to enter results for (selectGame)
    - Using HREF the user selects a game, and that game id is sent to view number 2.
2. Mark what players signed in, and add any new players if needed (gameReportRoster)
    - Using the game.id we run the following queries
        a. Get Home Team
        b. Get Away Team
        c. Get all Home Team Players
        d. Get all Away Team Players
        e. Generate Home Team Formset
        f. Generate Away Team Formset
    - We then add these to context and generate out template
    - Our Template loads a table for each team to mark off checked in players as well as 2 forms to add new players

    - Our post request gathers the following data
        a. List of all HomePlayers who Played
        b. List of all AwayPlayers who Played
        c. Formset data of all HomePlayers who Played
        d. Formset data of all AwayPlayers who Played
    - To process the data of the formsets
        - We loop through each formset, verifying it is valid and creating a new player object for each added player

    This completes what step 2 does

    At this point, our tempResults will hold the following
        1. Game
        2. HomePlayersPlayed
        3. AwayPlayersPlayed


3. Add Goals and Penalties for the game


Entering Game Results, requires the following workflow

1. User Selects a game to enter the score for
    - That game.id is needed
